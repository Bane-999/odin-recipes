        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Szechuan chicken, also known as Sichuan chicken, Mala Chicken or Laziji, 
            is a beautifully spiced stir-fried chicken dish, usually served dry, 
            rather than saucy, and characterised by the use of 
            Szechuan peppercorns and lots of dried red chillies.</p>
        <p>Originating in Chongqing (in Southwest China) it's a hugely popular dish. Often the chicken is deep-fried (I shallow-fry mine) and the amount of dried chillies in the dish tends to far outweigh the amount of chicken.
            I'm going a fair bit lighter on the chillies for my recipe. 
            However, if you leave them whole, they don't actually add 
            too much heat anyway. It's when they're chopped and those 
            chilli seeds are released that the heat level starts to increase!!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice wine</li>
            <li>Light soy souce</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First we marinate chicken thigh pieces in soy sauce, 
                rice wine, white pepper and cornflour.</li>
            <li>Then we fry the chicken in oil until 
                golden and remove from the pan.</li>
            <li>Next up we fry the dried chillies in a little sesame oil, 
                before adding in the ground Szechuan peppers, garlic, 
                ginger and spring onions.</li>
        </ol>
