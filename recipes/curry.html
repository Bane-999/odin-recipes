        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken curry is common to several countries including India, countries in Asia and the Caribbean</p>
        <p>Originating in Chongqing (in Southwest China) it's a hugely popular dish. Often the chicken is deep-fried (I shallow-fry mine) and the amount of dried chillies in the dish tends to far outweigh the amount of chicken.
            I'm going a fair bit lighter on the chillies for my recipe. 
            However, if you leave them whole, they don't actually add 
            too much heat anyway. It's when they're chopped and those 
            chilli seeds are released that the heat level starts to increase!!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil.</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped (1 cup)</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, minced (1 1/2 Tbsp)</li>
            <li>...</li>            
        </ul> 
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix spices together</li>
            <li>Saute onion, garlic and ginger in a skillet.</li>
            <li>Blend mixture in a blender as directed then return to skillet.</li>
        </ol>
